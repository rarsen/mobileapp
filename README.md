# Mobile App Development -  Internship Project

This repository showcases the mobile app I developed during my internship at CGS-team

### App Overview
This project demonstrates my experience as a Full-Stack Developer, focusing on mobile app development using **React Native** along with **Node.js** and **Nest.js** on the backend. The app integrates essential features and technologies for a seamless and scalable user experience, reflecting the requirements of modern mobile solutions.

### Key Features:
- **Cross-Platform Mobile Development**: Built with **React Native** to ensure a smooth experience on both iOS and Android platforms.
- **Backend Integration**: Developed using **Node.js** and **Nest.js**, connecting with a PostgreSQL database to store and manage app data.
- **API Integration**: Utilized **Postman** to test and integrate various APIs for efficient data flow between the frontend and backend.
- **TypeScript/JavaScript**: Applied TypeScript for type safety and scalability in both frontend and backend components.
- **Cloud Services**: Gained experience working with **AWS** and **Docker** to streamline deployment processes.
- **Additional Technologies**: **Postgres**, **Expo** for deployment and testing on mobile devices.

### Internship Experience:
During my internship, I worked closely with senior developer, receiving hands-on mentoring and improving my technical skills.

### Technologies Used:
- **Frontend**: React Native, TypeScript, Redux
- **Backend**: Node.js, Nest.js, PostgresSQL
- **Tools**: Postman, Expo,
- **Database**: PostgreSQL

This project highlights my progress in Full-Stack Mobile Development, and I look forward to building upon these skills in future roles.
